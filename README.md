# Plant Disease Detection

## Overview

The Plant Disease Detection project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and classify diseases in plants from images. This project aims to help farmers and gardeners quickly and accurately diagnose plant diseases, enabling timely and appropriate treatment to prevent crop loss and ensure healthy plant growth.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: The application uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze and classify plant images based on the presence of specific diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface allows users to upload images of their plants and receive instant feedback on the health status of the plant.
- **Disease Information**: The application provides detailed information about identified diseases, including symptoms, causes, and recommended treatments.
- **Scalability**: The model can be trained to recognize a wide range of plant diseases and can be extended to include more plant species and disease types.

## Usage

1. **Upload an Image**: Open the application and upload an image of the plant you want to diagnose.
2. **Get Diagnosis**: The application will process the image and provide a diagnosis, including the name of the disease (if any) and additional information.
3. **Review Recommendations**: Read the provided information on symptoms, causes, and treatment recommendations to address the plant disease.

## Model Training

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Collect and label images of healthy and diseased plants.
2. **Train the Model**: Use the dataset to train the machine learning model. The training process involves splitting the data into training and testing sets, preprocessing the images, and feeding them into the model.
3. **Evaluate the Model**: Assess the model's performance using appropriate metrics and validate its accuracy on the test set.
4. **Deploy the Model**: Integrate the trained model into the application for real-time disease detection.

## Dependencies
